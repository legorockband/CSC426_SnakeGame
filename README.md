# CPE-426 Hardware Security Final Porject - Snake Game

This repository contains a course project demonstrating a hardware trojan
inserted into a custom RISC-V FPGA design for educational hardware security project.

This project:
- Only targets a snake implementation on a RISC-V core on the Basys3 FPGA board

The trojan technique is demonstrated to study detection, mitigation, and secure hardware design practices.
